# Ethereum Proof-of-Stake Devnet with deployment of the EigenLayer contracts

## Introduction

This repository is a fork of the [POS DevNet](https://github.com/ivy-net/eth-pos-devnet) repository, extended by an automatic deployment of the EigenLayer contracts.

### Quick Start

Ensure that you have docker and packer installed and docker daemon is running.

Build the image with packer
```
cd eigenlayer
packer init .
packer build -var 'version=0.5' .
```
Start docker compose
```
cd ../
./clean.sh
docker-compose up -d
```

## Docker image to deploy EigneLayer

The docker image to deploy the EigenLayer contracts bases on the [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/foundry-docker) one.
During the build process the image is enriched by addition of the compile smart contracts from the EigenLayer Contracts and EigenLayer Middleware repositories.

The image is prepared with the [packer](https://www.packer.io/) tool by HashiCorp.
It is defined in the [eigenlayer-deploy.pkr.hcl](eigenlayer/eigenlayer-deploy.pkr.hcl) file.
The file can be easily extended (e.g. by addition of the AVS contracts).

## Extension of docker-compose

There are a few small adjustment to the original docker-compose code.
The most obvious one is addition of the new image with the EL code.
To enable deployment there are also small tweaks in the geth container definition.
Firstly, the healthcheck block is added.
It is to give time for blockchain to settle, before publishing the EL contracts.
Additionally, the insecure http connections are permitted from the remote hosts.
This change enables forge (from the foundry image) to deployed the code.


## Ethereum Proof-of-Stake Devnet

_The original documentation_


This repository provides a docker-compose file to run a fully-functional, local development network for Ethereum with proof-of-stake enabled. This configuration uses [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) as a consensus client and [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) for execution. **It starts from proof-of-stake** and does not go through the Ethereum merge.

This sets up a single node development network with 64 deterministically-generated validator keys to drive the creation of blocks in an Ethereum proof-of-stake chain. Here's how it works:

1. We initialize a go-ethereum, proof-of-work development node from a genesis config
2. We initialize a Prysm beacon chain, proof-of-stake development node from a genesis config

The development net is fully functional and allows for the deployment of smart contracts and all the features that also come with the Prysm consensus client such as its rich set of APIs for retrieving data from the blockchain. This development net is a great way to understand the internals of Ethereum proof-of-stake and to mess around with the different settings that make the system possible.

## Using

First, install Docker. Then, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/rauljordan/eth-pos-devnet && cd eth-pos-devnet
./clean.sh
docker compose up -d
```

You will see the following:

```
$ docker compose up -d
[+] Running 7/7
 ⠿ Network eth-pos-devnet_default                          Created
 ⠿ Container eth-pos-devnet-geth-genesis-1                 Started
 ⠿ Container eth-pos-devnet-create-beacon-chain-genesis-1  Started
 ⠿ Container eth-pos-devnet-geth-account-1                 Started
 ⠿ Container eth-pos-devnet-geth-1                         Started
 ⠿ Container eth-pos-devnet-beacon-chain-1                 Started
 ⠿ Container eth-pos-devnet-validator-1                    Started
```

Each time you restart, you can wipe the old data using `./clean.sh`.

Next, you can inspect the logs of the different services launched.

```
docker logs eth-pos-devnet-geth-1 -f
```

and see:

# Available Features

- Starts from the Capella Ethereum hard fork
- The network launches with a [Validator Deposit Contract](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/solidity_deposit_contract/deposit_contract.sol) deployed at address `0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242`. This can be used to onboard new validators into the network by depositing 32 ETH into the contract
- The default account used in the go-ethereum node is address `0x123463a4b065722e99115d6c222f267d9cabb524` which comes seeded with ETH for use in the network. This can be used to send transactions, deploy contracts, and more
- The default account, `0x123463a4b065722e99115d6c222f267d9cabb524` is also set as the fee recipient for transaction fees proposed validators in Prysm. This address will be receiving the fees of all proposer activity
- The go-ethereum JSON-RPC API is available at http://geth:8545
- The Prysm client's REST APIs are available at http://beacon-chain:3500. For more info on what these APIs are, see [here](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/)
- The Prysm client also exposes a gRPC API at http://beacon-chain:4000
